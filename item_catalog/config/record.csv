2016-01-21 02:53:20,2016-01-21 02:53:20,4,"O Brother, Where Art Thou?",4,4,2015,"Limited double vinyl LP picture disc pressing. The critical consensus at the end of 2000 was that it had been one of the weakest film years in recent memory. Which may have been true, despite O Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Coen brothers' delightfully warm and weird Depression-era re-telling of Homer's Odyssey. But for music lovers, 2000 was an amazing year at the movies, and it produced several excellent soundtrack compilations including Almost Famous, Dancer in the Dark, Wonder Boys, and High Fidelity. Even with such steep competition, the soundtrack album for O Brother, Where Art Thou? may be the best of the year. in order to capture the sound of Mississippi circa 1932, the Coens commissioned T-Bone Burnett, a masterful producer whose work with artists like Elvis Costello, Sam Phillips, Joseph Arthur, and Counting Crows has earned him a special place in the folk-rock hall of fame, to research and re-create the country, bluegrass, folk, gospel, and blues of the era."

The lyrics are central to the whole enterprise. Many of the songs involve desperate characters who've found themselves in some trouble. The Mountain Goats is a band led by American singer-songwriter John Darnielle. He began recording in 1991, and he has become known for his highly literary lyrics and, until 2002, his lo-fi recording style. The album is summed up in the final two songs: 'Love, Love, Love' and 'Pale Green Things'."
